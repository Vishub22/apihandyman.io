I built the OpenAPI map because I was constantly searching for "how do this with the OpenAPI spec" and also "but where is that thing" in the specification. Having the OpenAPI specification represented as a tree given essential information and quick access to source documentation of each element saved me countless time.

The OpenAPI map helps people find their way in the OpenAPI Specification. It provides a simple view of the specification and an easy access to the documentation of all of its elements.
