In API I trust, I’m an API believer.

# About me

My name is Arnaud Lauret, currently IT architect in Paris, France.
  
I have been working in IT banking on back and front office for almost 13 years as programmer, project manager, application and team manager and then IT architect.

Being IT architect after being manager may seem odd (especially in France): one day I realized that I had moved myself away (personally and professionally) to far from what I really like: getting my hands dirty with technology (it’s started with an Apple II in the 80's).
  
I was not completely out of technology things but not near enough and I had to do many other things that were really not my cup of tea.
  
Luckily when I mentioned my necessity of change, my manager and my company understand this. My company was seeking an IT architect and due to my experience on the company’s information system I have been proposed this job which I accepted gladly.
  
It was time to roll up my sleeves and get my hands dirty.

# About API Handyman blog

> Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of APIs?!  
> (Marty McApy) 

Born on the seventh of February 2015, the API Handyman blog is about sharing my views and experiences on the API field from both provider and consumer points of view with (I hope) a pragmatic and unvarnished approach.

My API awareness grown up working on my company's information system:

  * Evolving from client/server to SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) and then to API.
  * Consuming services in our web sites and mobile applications.
  * Designing and providing services for us and partners.
  * Integrating and consuming partner’s services.
  * Working with internal and external developers.

This blog is born from the combination of my desire to share what I learn, learn from others experiences and my child mind. I want to play with APIs (and all that resolves around this) as I used to play with Lego when I was a kid and create cool things. Cool things like a time machine.

# But why API Handyman?

I wanted a _secret_ identity with a _mind-blowing_ name to be this blog's personification.
  
But cool names like evangelist, barbarian, sorcerer, wizard, magician were already used … There should be an API to help finding cool names.
  
After some _really intense_ brainstorming I found _handyman_.

> The term handyman or handyperson increasingly describes a paid worker, but it also includes non-paid homeowners or do-it-yourselfers. Tasks range from minor to major, from unskilled to highly skilled, and include painting, drywall repair, remodeling, minor plumbing work, minor electrical work, household carpentry, sheetrock, crown moulding, and furniture assembly.

This is what I am at home or with technology, this blog is about API so the API Handyman is born.
  
Pretty clever isn’t it?
