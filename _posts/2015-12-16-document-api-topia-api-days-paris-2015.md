I had the luck to be helped by two great persons when preparing this talk, [Jennifer Riggins](https://twitter.com/jkriggins) and [Paul Bruce](https://twitter.com/paulsbruce). Both gave me precious feedbacks and tips. Many great thanks to them!

I talked about an ideal world where API (and software) and documentation live in perfect harmony, describing some crazy ideas such as *documentation continuous delivery* or *documentation package manager* but also stating that we need both machines and humans to create this ideal world. [Jennifer Riggins](https://twitter.com/jkriggins) wrote a blog post about my [Document-API-topia](http://blog.smartbear.com/documentation/the-utopia-of-api-documentation/) published on Smartbear's Blog.
