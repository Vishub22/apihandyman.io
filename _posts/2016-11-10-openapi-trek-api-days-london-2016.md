I was thrilled to start my OpenAPI specification (fka. Swagger specification) talk series at API Days London with this first part simply titled OpenAPI Trek.

This series is composed of three talks:

- OpenAPI Trek at API Days London 2016
- [OpenAPI Trek Into Fastness at Nordic APIs Stockholm Summit 2016](http://apihandyman.io/openapi-trek-into-fastness-nordic-apis-summit-2016/)
- OpenAPI Trek Beyond API Documentation at APIStrat Boston 2016 (post coming soon)

This first talk, *OpenAPI Trek*, aims to explain what is the OpenAPI specification and how it can be extensively used throughout the API lifecycle. Here are the video and slides:
