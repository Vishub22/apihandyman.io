After API Days London, I've been to the Nordic APIs Summit in Stockholm for the second part of my OpenAPI specification (fka. Swagger specification) talk series with *OpenAPI Trek Into Fastness*.

This series is composed of three talks:

- [OpenAPI Trek at API Days London 2016](http://apihandyman.io/openapi-trek-api-days-london-2016/)
- OpenAPI Trek Into Fastness at Nordic APIs Stockholm Summit 2016
- OpenAPI Trek Beyond API Documentation at APIStrat Boston 2016 (post coming soon)

> Fastness means being fast.
> But it also means being secured.

This talk shows how to attain API Fastness with the OpenAPI specification. Here are the video and slides:
